# CS598DLHFinalProject

This is our final project for CS598 DLH - Spring 2025.

We have attempted to recreate the paper "Explaining a Machine Learning Decision to Physicians via Counterfactuals," available here: https://github.com/supriyanagesh94/CFVAE  

QUICK START

1) Open "DLHFinalProject.ipynb" in Google Colab. Using colab, you do not need to download any external packages.
2) Ensure that you run the first cell where the github repo is cloned into the runtime. The cloned repo will include all the data necessary to run the experiments. 
3) Explore the different experiments! We have included section titles and comments within the code to explain the various steps.
