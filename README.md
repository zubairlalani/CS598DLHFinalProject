# CS598DLHFinalProject

This is our final project for CS598 DLH - Spring 2025.

We have attempted to recreate the paper "Explaining a Machine Learning Decision to Physicians via Counterfactuals," available here: https://github.com/supriyanagesh94/CFVAE  

In order to run this code, you will need to have Python Version 3 installed.

Please import the entire repository with all the included files to run it successfully. We recommend using Google Colab, as you will not need to download any additional libraries.

1) Open Colab. Using colab, you do not need to download any external packages.
2) Ensure that you run the first cell where the github repo is cloned into the runtime. The cloned repo will include all the data necessary to run the experiments. 
3) That's it!
