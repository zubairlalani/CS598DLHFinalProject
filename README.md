# CS598DLHFinalProject

This is our final project for CS598 DLH - Spring 2025.

We have attempted to recreate the paper "Explaining a Machine Learning Decision to Physicians via Counterfactuals," available here: https://github.com/supriyanagesh94/CFVAE  

In order to run this code, you will need to have Python Version 3 installed.

Please import the entire repository with all the included files to run it successfully. We recommend using Google Collab, as you will not need to download any additional libraries.
